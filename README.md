Keyboard events for react-native

## Example

```javascript
// require the module
var KeyboardEvents = require('react-native-keyboardevents');

// Now get a handle on the event emitter and add your callbacks
// to the desired events.
var KeyboardEventEmitter = KeyboardEvents.Emitter;

// Each event will receive a `frames` object, which contains two keys -
// `begin` and `end` Those keys each contain an object describing the bounds
// of the keyboard (x, y, width and height).
//
// The frame in `begin` describes the bounds of the keyboard before the
// animation occurred and the frame in `end` describes the bounds the keyboard
// will have, after the animation has completed.
KeyboardEventEmitter.on(KeyboardEvents.KeyboardWillShowEvent, (frames) => {
  console.log('will show', frames);
});

KeyboardEventEmitter.on(KeyboardEvents.KeyboardDidShowEvent, (frames) => {
  console.log('did show', frames);
});

KeyboardEventEmitter.on(KeyboardEvents.KeyboardWillHideEvent, (frames) => {
  console.log('will hide', frames);
});

KeyboardEventEmitter.on(KeyboardEvents.KeyboardDidHideEvent, (frames) => {
  console.log('did hide', frames);
});
```
